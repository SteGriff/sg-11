# sg-11

This is SteGriff's 11ty template.

This website is powered by the static site generator, [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev).

All pages use the layout `_includes/_layouts/default.njk`

All the CSS is in the `public/style.css` file, to reduce requests and make the site faster. The CSS file includes the [Tachyons][tac] atomic CSS library.

Content is written in markdown, see `index.md`, `profiles.md`, etc. The markdown pages can use [Liquid][lq] syntax.

Global site data is in `_data/siteData.json`.
