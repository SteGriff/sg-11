<h2>Southport Skylarks ‚Äì <small class="gray">Ste Griffiths</small></h2>
<p class="gray i">
Despite it's unlikely locale, the Skylarks attract the best of NFL talent thanks to Southport's subtropical Florida-like climate and what some have called 'exploitative' visa arrangements

    <h2>Esquel Collies  &ndash; <small class="gray">Helen Griffiths</small></h2>
    <p class="gray i">
      Rhumba and Mora are the real Esquel Collies. One year they killed 16 birds by grabbing them out of the sky. Now we're gonna crush it like they crush little birdie bones!

    <h2>Packers FC &ndash; <small class="gray">Brandon Meadow</small></h2>
    <p class="gray i">
      Packers FC were originally a Peckham-based association football club, but after growing tired of low pay and nil-nil draws, they chose to move the team to the desirable fish-packing district of New England and take up a more interesting sport. (Fact added by the editor)

      After doing abysmally for a couple of decades, Hugh Laurie and Tony Robinson bought out the team to see if they could finally take them to the playoffs and ultimately the Super Bowl.

    <h2>Naperville Bearcats &ndash; <small class="gray">Mike Wallbank</small></h2>
    <p class="gray i">
      Naperville is the city I live in (~30 miles west of Chicago) and Bearcats is the name of the athletics teams at the University of Cincinnati, where I‚Äôm employed. It was a historic season for the Cincinnati Bearcats football team last season, the first non-power 5 conference team to make the playoffs, and I really got into college football for the first time and made it to a game, so I had to name my team after them!
