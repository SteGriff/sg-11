  <p class="gray i">
    Despite it's unlikely locale, the Skylarks attract the best of NFL talent thanks to Southport's subtropical Florida-like climate and what some have called 'exploitative' visa arrangements

    Packers FC were originally a Peckham-based association football club, but after growing tired of low pay and nil-nil draws, they chose to move the team to the desirable fish-packing district of New England and take up a more interesting sport. (Fact added by the editor)

  <h2>Naperville Bearcats &ndash; <small class="gray">Mike Wallbank</small></h2>
  <p class="gray i">
    Naperville is the city I live in (~30 miles west of Chicago) and Bearcats is the name of the athletics teams at the University of Cincinnati, where I‚Äôm employed. It was a historic season for the Cincinnati Bearcats football team last season, the first non-power 5 conference team to make the playoffs, and I really got into college football for the first time and made it to a game, so I had to name my team after them!

  <h2>Country Road Take Mahomes &ndash; <small class="gray">Andrew Trebble</small></h2>
  <p class="gray i">
    The Mahomey's as they are affectionately known, are based in the blossoming community of Liverpool... Huyton! Although Liverpool is strongly associated with Soccer, the good folks of Huyton have ventured further a field as they have drawn weary of the Klopp / Lampard style of play - gravitating to the free wheeling style of the Mahomey's. More recently small section of the fan base have become disgruntled by odd decisions made by the team owner "Andrew Trebble", specifically not drafting a QB in the first round of the draft (like other more popular owners) and ending up with seemingly no QB options for the upcoming season, this has led to the lesser known "Trebble Out" movement!
