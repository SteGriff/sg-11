        Draft Report 2022
      </h1>
      
      <p>The draft room was thick with the aroma of pizza and the tension of coiled banter, ready to be sprung upon unsuspecting peers.</p>
<p>For those on the other end of a zoom call, 20 to 4000 miles away, the only thing louder than the internal screaming were occassional quips of an unrelated Soccer Match, its audio leeching over the mic from the command centre.</p>
<p>Visibly shaken by the discovery they had the first overall pick, Ste Griffiths, General Manager of the Skylarks, hung his head. After a protracted period of hair-pulling and hand-wringing, the reflexive decision to take Josh Allen as 1.1 was met with braying laughter from those who knew better.</p>
<p>But the suprises wouldn't stop there.</p>
<p>In</p>
