      <h1>
        Week 1
      </h1>
      
      <p>The Pigskin Junkie Football League (PJFL) enjoyed its inaugural week of competition. Who took an early lead, and who lost out?</p>
<h2>High rollers face off</h2>
<p>Third season manager, Mike Wallbank, of the <em>Naperville Bearcats</em> (<span class='js-tc NAP'>NAP</span>), took a win and an early points lead, topping the table with 129.06.</p>
<p>Wallbank commented &quot;Very happy with the result, good reflection on the work the boys have put in. Hoping Herbert can keep it up against the Chiefs of Thursday&quot;. Indeed, Herbert had a great day, and almost every player for <span class='js-tc NAP'>NAP</span> met or outperformed expectations with the notable exception of the Packers Defence.</p>
<p>In fact, the loser in the matchup - Jonny Hubble and his side, <em>Burrow row row your boat</em> (<span class='js-tc BRR'>BRR</span>) - became the league's highest scoring winless team.</p>
<p>The match was close thanks to unexpectedly great performances by Miles Sanders and Ja'marr Chase, as well as the Ravens D.</p>
<p>But, Hubble had trouble at tight end, with second choice Uzomah coming away pointsless, untargeted, neglected by the QB. The manager vented his frustration with his benched would-be-star, &quot;I wanna call out George Kittle for being injured every week, I don't think he realises the stakes I have on the line&quot;</p>
<h2>Benched hench</h2>
<p>Many coaches and managers complained this week about the points on their benches, as starters disappointed, and their would-be replacements excelled.</p>
<p>Andrew Trebble couldn't hide his frustration with side <em>Country Road Take Mahomes</em> (<span class='js-tc CRT'>CRT</span>), as Fields, Carter, Gibson, and Kirk all outperformed their on-field teammates.</p>
<h2>Around the league</h2>
<p>Elsewhere in the league, newcomer Grace Joslin, of <em>The category is 'country love'</em> (<span class='js-tc CCL'>CCL</span>), endured a bad start, hampered particularly by Dak Prescott excusing himself from an already poor effort by breaking his thumb on a linebacker.</p>
<p>Bryn Joslin and <em>The Brady Bunch</em> (<span class='js-tc TBB'>TBB</span>) were projected a close game against <em>The Cheetahs</em> (<span class='js-tc CHE'>CHE</span>), and did in fact put in a solid performance, but lost out due to some underwhelming depth at WR and world-ending scores from opposition players Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Cooper Kupp, who laid down a combined 54.2 points on their own.</p>
<p>Naz El-harrati's side were in the top-four despite naysayers to his idiosyncratic draft technique. <em>The Cheetahs</em> look to repeat the trick this weekend against <em>Beginners Luck</em> (<span class='js-tc BGL'>BGL</span>).</p>
<p>The final joke of the weekend's games came in the form of bitter payback for Younghoe Koo, who, taking umbridge with words from the opposing coach (&quot;You don't need to draft a kicker&quot; or perhaps &quot;Who cares about kickers&quot; - I wasn't there), put up 18 points on the board, creating the swing that <em>Beginners Luck</em> needed to defeat Kendrew's <em>Mayfield Bakery</em> (<span class='js-tc MFB'>MFB</span>) by 116 to 102. &quot;Well... I lost week 1 of 13&quot; said Kendrew, putting the loss in perspective.</p>
<p>Will the top four - the 120 club - go on to win again in Week 2? Or will fortunes be reversed? Who will be the surprise victors as the competition enters its second week?</p>
<p>Anything can happen and the numbers are all wrong. That's the NFL, baby üèàüë∂</p>
