      <h1>
        Week 1
      </h1>
      
      <p>The Pigskin Junkie Football League (PJFL) enjoyed its inaugural week of competition. Who took an early lead, and who lost out?</p>
<p>Third season manager, Mike Wallbank, of the Naperville Bearcats (NAP), took a win and an early points lead, topping the table with 129.06.</p>
<p>Wallbank commented &quot;Very happy with the result, good reflection on the work the boys have put in. Hoping Herbert can keep it up against the Chiefs of Thursday&quot;. Indeed, Herbert had a great day, and almost every player for NAP met or outperformed expectations with the notable exception of the Packers Defence.</p>
<p>In fact, the loser in the matchup - Jonny Hubble and his side, Burrow row row your boat (BRR) - became the league's highest scoring winless team.</p>
<p>The match was close thanks to unexpectedly great performances by Miles Sanders and Ja'marr Chase, as well as the Ravens D.</p>
<p>But, Hubble had trouble at tight end, with second choice Uzomah coming away pointsless, neglected by the QB. The manager vented his frustration with his benched would-be-star, &quot;I wanna call out George Kittle for being injured every week, I don't think he realises the stakes I have on the line&quot;</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the league, newcomer Grace Joslin , of The category is 'country love' (CCL), endured a bad start, hampered particularly by Dak Prescott's broken thumb.</p>
<p>Bryn Joslin and The Brady Bunch (TBB) were projected a close game against The Cheetahs (CHE), and did in fact put in a solid performance, but lost out due to some underwhelming depth at WR and world-ending scores from opposition players Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Cooper Kupp, who laid down a combined 54.2 points on their own.</p>
<p>El-harrati's side were in the top-four despite naysayers of his idiosyncratic draft technique. They look to repeat the trick this weekend against Beginners Luck (BGL).</p>
