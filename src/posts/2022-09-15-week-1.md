The Pigskin Junkie Football League (PJFL) enjoyed its inaugural week of competition. Who took an early lead, and who lost out?

Third season manager, Mike Wallbank, of the Naperville Bearcats (NAP), took a win and an early points lead, topping the table with 129.06. 

Wallbank commented "Very happy with the result, good reflection on the work the boys have put in. Hoping Herbert can keep it up against the Chiefs of Thursday". Indeed, Herbert had a great day, and almost every player for NAP met or outperformed expectations with the notable exception of the Packers Defence.

In fact, the loser in the matchup - Jonny Hubble and his side, Burrow row row your boat (BRR) - became the league's highest scoring winless team.

The match was close thanks to unexpectedly great performances by Miles Sanders and Ja'marr Chase, as well as the Ravens D.

But, Hubble had trouble at tight end, with second choice Uzomah coming away pointsless, neglected by the QB. The manager vented his frustration with his benched would-be-star, "I wanna call out George Kittle for being injured every week, I don't think he realises the stakes I have on the line"

Elsewhere in the league, newcomer Grace Joslin , of The category is 'country love' (CCL), endured a bad start, hampered particularly by Dak Prescott's broken thumb.

Bryn Joslin and The Brady Bunch (TBB) were projected a close game against The Cheetahs (CHE), and did in fact put in a solid performance, but lost out due to some underwhelming depth at WR and world-ending scores from opposition players Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Cooper Kupp, who laid down a combined 54.2 points on their own.

El-harrati's side were in the top-four despite naysayers of his idiosyncratic draft technique. They look to repeat the trick this weekend against Beginners Luck (BGL).
